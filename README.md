This is a repository that has the neccessary code for creating a weekly calendar in android studio. Since android studio does not have a built in weekly calendar and other repos have certain problem with syncing. I decided to do this on my own for project purpose. But soon decided to publish it here for other to use it.

Using just the calendar and Date built in class of java, we can do this. for the days of the weeks, I generated them by using a recycler view. and for calculating each day, we have a separate class which will give us the month, day and date. the other UI are set up in the main activity xml. For giving it more good appearance i have given a sliding right and sliding left effect when you move through the weeks. 
Hope this repo is useful to you!
